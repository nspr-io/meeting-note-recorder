YOUR TASK:
Create the executive summary and follow-up list for this meeting.

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:
1. Prioritize the personal notes as the source of truth; use the transcript to fill gaps or confirm details without contradicting the notes.
2. Focus on strategic outcomes, context, and implications that matter to an executive audience.
3. Highlight unresolved questions or dependencies as follow-ups instead of guessing at answers.
4. Keep the writing concise, factual, and free of fluff while preserving necessary context.

Return ONLY valid JSON in this format:
{
  "summary": "2-3 paragraph executive summary grounded in the notes and supported by transcript context",
  "followUps": [
    "Outstanding question or dependency that needs follow-up",
    "Another follow-up item if applicable"
  ]
}
