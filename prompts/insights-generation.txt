YOUR TASK:
Analyze the meeting content and produce structured insights that are immediately actionable and valuable.

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:
1. Personal notes are the PRIMARY source - they reflect what the user considered important
2. Use the transcript to provide context and fill gaps, but NEVER contradict the notes
3. Be concise but comprehensive - every word should add value
4. Focus on outcomes: decisions made, actions required, and strategic implications
5. Write action items that are specific, measurable, and assignable
6. Highlight strategic insights and patterns that an exec would care about
7. If something seems important but unclear, mark it for follow-up rather than guessing
