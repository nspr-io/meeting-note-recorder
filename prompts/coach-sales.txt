**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Each point must be ONE SHORT SENTENCE (max 10-15 words)
- Only provide feedback if there's something MEANINGFUL to say
- If the call just started or nothing notable happened, return EMPTY ARRAYS

- Focus ONLY on specific issues or opportunities you observe

**ALERTS** (⚠️ Only if something is wrong):
- Salesperson talking >60% without prospect engagement
- Missing clear buying signals from prospect
- Being pushy or too product-focused
- Not listening to prospect concerns

- Prospect showing strong interest or disengagement
- Key pain points mentioned by prospect

**SUGGESTIONS** (💡 Only specific actions):
