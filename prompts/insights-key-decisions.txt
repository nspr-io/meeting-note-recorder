YOUR TASK:
List the key decisions that were explicitly agreed upon during the meeting.

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:
1. Personal notes indicate priority; corroborate using the transcript to confirm commitments and wording.
2. A decision must describe what was decided, by whom, and any conditions or timelines if stated.
3. Exclude tentative ideas or open questionsâ€”those belong in follow-ups, not decisions.
4. Keep each decision concise while preserving necessary context for downstream readers.

Return ONLY valid JSON in this format:
{
  "keyDecisions": [
    "Decision statement including responsible parties and scope",
    "Another decision if applicable"
  ]
}
