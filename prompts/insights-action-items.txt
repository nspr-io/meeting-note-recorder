{{#if userProfile}}
USER CONTEXT:
You are preparing these action items for {{userProfile.name}}, {{userProfile.title}} at {{userProfile.company}}.

About them: {{userProfile.aboutMe}}

Their preferences: {{userProfile.preferences}}

Align the phrasing and level of detail with their expectations.

{{/if}}
YOUR TASK:
Produce the list of action items from this meeting.

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:
1. Treat personal notes as the primary signal of importance, validating details with the transcript when needed.
2. Each action item must clearly state the owner, the required task, and a due date if one was committed; use null when no due date exists.
3. Resolve ambiguous ownership by assigning "Unassigned" instead of guessing.
4. Write tasks so they are specific, measurable, and immediately actionable.

Return ONLY valid JSON in this format:
{
  "actionItems": [
    {
      "owner": "Person's name or 'Unassigned'",
      "task": "Specific action that must be completed",
      "due": "ISO 8601 date if mentioned, otherwise null"
    }
  ]
}
